#Some interesting thing I found:
#The probabilities are mutually exclusive because and you can not be vaccinated and not vaccinated at the some time
#Also, one can not be in high school and advanced degree at the same time
#The probabilities are exhaustive because the probability of education and 
#not getting vaccinated and the probability of education and getting vaccinated is equal to 1.
#There is a positive correlation with education and vaccination
#More people with higher education got vaccinated than not vaccinated
#It is more likely than you are vaccinated than not vaccinated with higher education
#There could be other factors that impacted as well such as income and age
